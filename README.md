# Space Shooter

This is my **second Unity project**, built as part of my journey to gain more hands-on experience in game development. It's a simple, playable space shooter game where the player controls a ship, avoids asteroids, and scores points — all developed using Unity and C#.

## 🎯 Purpose

After completing my first Unity project, I wanted to **dig deeper into gameplay mechanics** and object behavior. This project was about pushing myself further, trying to understand how real-time object movement, game flow, and player interactions work in Unity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Unity  
- C#  
- Unity’s built-in physics and UI systems

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

The most challenging part was implementing **asteroid movement and behavior.** Getting the flow right, managing object spawning, and creating a smooth gameplay loop took focused effort.

## 🚀 What I’m Proud Of

This project resulted in a **fully playable game** with actual feedback, collision, and interaction. Even though it’s small in scale, finishing something functional and fun was a huge motivator.

## 👀 Why It Matters

This isn’t just a space shooter.  
It’s a checkpoint in the path of someone **actively learning and building.**  
If you're reading this and wondering about my skills: I don't just study — I build, test, and improve.

## 📈 Next Improvements

- Add score tracking and a game-over screen  
- Polish movement animations  
- Enhance the UI/UX for smoother feedback
